				UK steelmakers have warned that the imposition of new US tariffs would be “a devastating blow” to the industry, after Donald Trump said he would announce 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US.

Gold reached a record high and aluminium prices rose as financial markets were rattled by the US president’s comments, which caused concern in the UK and the EU.

Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said: “The US is our second-largest export market after the EU. At a time of shrinking demand and high costs, rising protectionism globally, particularly in the US, will stifle our exports and damage over £400m worth of the steel sector’s contribution to the UK’s balance of trade.”

Stace said it would be “deeply disappointing” if Trump decided to target UK steel, given its “relatively small production volumes compared to major steel nations”.

He added that there was a danger that other countries could decide to dump steel on the UK market to avoid US tariffs. “The introduction of further US tariffs will inevitably divert global trade flows, with excess steel potentially redirected to the UK market,” he said.

UK Steel’s members include Tata, the owner of the vast Port Talbot steelworks, and troubled British Steel, owned by China’s Jingye.

Trump is expected to formally announce new tariffs this week. Community, the union for the UK steel industry, said the prospect of fresh duties was extremely concerning and could threaten jobs.

Alasdair McDiarmid, the Community assistant general secretary, said: “For the US it would also be self-defeating as the UK is a leading supplier of specialist steel products required by their defence and aerospace sectors.”

The European Commission said: “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.”

As investors rushed for a haven for their money, the spot price of gold increased by 1.6% to $2,910 an ounce, above the record high set on Friday. Gold has been rising in recent weeks amid concerns over the impact of Trump’s policies. It has gained more than 10% since the start of the year, after ending 2024 at $2,623 an ounce.
